DNS PING v0.7
1997 Thomas H. Ptacek
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Included in this distribution is the source code to a DNS "ping" 
utility, intended to assist in the benchmarking of DNS servers. 
This code has been compiled and tested under 4.4BSD, including
FreeBSD 2.x and OpenBSD 2.x.

I have not attempted to port this software to any non-4.4BSD 
platform. Unlike a previous version, this does not rely on 
packet capture (don't ask) or forgery (don't ask). It shouldn't
be too hard to port. If you do manage a port, please send me email.

+ Ye gods, I got it to work on Solaris. 

There's a "man" page included with the distribution; read it if
you have questions as to how this works.
